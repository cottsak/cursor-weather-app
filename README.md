# Cursor Demo 1.0

This app is an experiment into my personal learnings with Cursor. 

The following requirements are interpreted from this [coding challenge](/Mobility%20-%20Technical%20Challenge%20-%20Weather%20App.docx). 

## TODO

* [ ] create a dotnet console app which takes a single parameter: the `$city` which the user wants to get the weather for.
* [ ] add a switch `-list` which shows the recent searches.
* [ ] a call to a `$city` which is not older than 1h much return a cached response.
* [ ] refactor these requirements into a web application instead and pivot the project
